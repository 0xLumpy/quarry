"""run_contract() — the enforced-contract wrapper over runner.run (v0.3 stabilization, step 2).

THIN by design. It:
  1. reads the source's contract from the registry (``sources.get``),
  2. emits structured events (``events``) around the call, and
  3. delegates execution UNCHANGED to ``runner.run``, returning its RunResult untouched.

It does NOT rewrite runner behavior, and no phase imports it yet — additive, zero behavior change,
same safety posture as step 1's declarative registry. The danger-tool conversion (step 4) is where
call sites move onto it, one bounded source at a time.

Produced/consumed counts are NOT emitted here: the parser/store runs later inside the phase, so the
honest place to report real counts is a ``events.ledger(source_id, produced=…, consumed=…)`` call the
phase makes AFTER it parses. We never guess counts from stdout. See [[quarry-bbot-control-surface]].
